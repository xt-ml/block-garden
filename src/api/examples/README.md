## [Sprite Garden - API - Examples](https://kherrick.github.io/sprite-garden/src/api/examples/)

The **`Sprite Garden` API Examples** demo visual and interactive effects players can build upon with their own ideas. Each example is a standalone ES module that can be loaded dynamically—either directly from a browser console, a script import, or via a provided bookmarklet.

These examples are particularly useful for learning how to work with **Sprite Garden’s 2D rendering environment**, **state management**, and **procedural world manipulation** features, which power the game engine’s sandbox-style mechanics. The bookmarklets make it possible to run these demos directly within the game by injecting small modules that render real-time graphics or interactions using the Sprite Garden runtime.

### Overview of Usage

Players can use these examples to:

- Explore how rendering, physics, and animation logic are structured within Sprite Garden.
- Prototype visuals (like fireworks, hearts, or tile-based growth patterns).
- Understand interactivity via input handling and messaging.
- Test how API modules combine visual creation (sprites, particles, animations) with event handling and game logic.
- Learn how modular ES6 imports can dynamically add effects or test procedural generation behaviors directly in the game.

Each source corresponds to a themed animation or behavior. Click here to access bookmarklets and see more details.
