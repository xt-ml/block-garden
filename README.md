## Tips for New Players

- Start by exploring your immediate surroundings to understand the biome
- Harvest natural crops to build up your seed inventory
- Look for farmable ground (dirt, grass, clay, sand) to plant seeds
- Different crops grow at different rates - mushrooms are fastest, trees are slowest
- Mine resources by breaking blocks (R key) - you'll collect materials automatically
- Fog clears as exploration progresses
- Save your game frequently using the World State menu (Ctrl+S)
- Share interesting worlds with friends!
